## About The Project ##
 This Project is a challenge by [Zack Gollwitzer](https://twitter.com/zg_dev) about javascript. In this Project he already provided the database and a function to access the content. I inserted that content into the html doument. As it was a chellenge regarding javascript and html, the css was also provided by Zach.

 I made different functions to insert and remove the different content elements using javascript and DOM. Also, I used some logic for exception handling when the riddle answer is already shown and user asks for answer again, and also for when no riddle is shoqn and user asks for riddle answer
