## About The Project ##
 This Project is a challenge by [Zack Gollwitzer](https://twitter.com/zg_dev) about javascript. In this Project he already provided the database and a function to access the content. I inserted that content into the html doument. As it was a chellenge regarding javascript and html, the css was also provided by Zach.

 I made different functions to insert and remove the different content elements using javascript and DOM.
